Design Choices

React + Vite Frontend: React handles the dynamic UI, using useEffect and useState to manage city selection and loading state.

Laravel API: An endpoint at /api/forecast?city=CityName fetches and returns clean JSON data formatted for the frontend.

Fallback States: Includes UI handling for loading, errors, and no data conditions.

AccuWeather API: Offers accurate 5-day forecasts, accessed via a custom Laravel AccuWeatherService class, and is free to use.

Daily Report: Task Brief intro mentions daily generated report, but no details and expectations in Success Critiera:
    
Created app\Console\Commands\GenerateDailyForecastReport.php to gather forecast data that day from Brisbane, Gold Coast, and Sunshine Coast that genrates a txt file in app\storage\app\reports e.g. 
    
    app\storage\app\reports\weather_report_2025-06-16.txt
